# We Import Two Thirds Of Our Cheese

That is a disgrace.



## Development Environment

I'm using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Just do:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TheTeaCat/incheesewetruss.com.git
cd incheesewetruss.com
npm run watch
```



## Deployment

I'm deploying to Cloudflare pages. Just run `npm run build` and publish the `dist` directory.
